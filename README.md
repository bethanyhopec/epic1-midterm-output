# Mandala Art
:sunny:
 
  The mandala art has central point and it is surrounded by beautiful patterns and there are decorations connected and interrelated. It symbolizes everything and the patterns are never ending. I come up with this design through youtube video https://www.youtube.com/watch?fbclid=IwAR16qmwjpXmnIUwqr84NSiN0thKce-fgiqryaHOxFz_2SPTGNLTsMR_WExQ&v=vCH1RFNnl2o&feature=youtu.be. I based my code in this video and create my own mandala art design using python turtle 

# Design
 The colors of my mandala is orange and yellow and the background is black. The design I made is very simple yet very meaningful because the design of my mandala art symbolizes or represent the sun,the  sun as a symbol of life and energy. And It radiates me as a person because as a human being we exist and life as a proof and the energy inside me gives me hope to live. Despite of the struggles in life, the never ending patterns in mandala art is like a never ending problem which forms and builds us to become stronger to face the reality of life. All the never-ending challenges made us to be more beautiful as we continue to live we also learn a lot of lessons that teaches us that life starts with a simple lines and patterns until it creates wonderful as how it should be.
 
 Thank you :smiley:
