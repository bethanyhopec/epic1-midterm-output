# Mandala Art
:sunny:
 
 The word Mandala comes from the ancient Indian language (Sanskrit), which means a Circle or Center. The mandala art has central point and it is surrounded by beautiful patterns and there are decorations connected and interrelated. It symbolizes everything and the patterns are never ending. I come up with this idea through youtube video https://www.youtube.com/watch?fbclid=IwAR16qmwjpXmnIUwqr84NSiN0thKce-fgiqryaHOxFz_2SPTGNLTsMR_WExQ&v=vCH1RFNnl2o&feature=youtu.be. I based my code in this video and create my own mandala art design.

 The design of my mandala art symbolizes or represent the sun, the sun as a symbol of life and energy. The colors of my mandala is orange and yellow. Orange because it represents vitality, heat and energy while yellow represents wisdom and learning, it can also represent rich wealth and prosperity. Aside from these yellow also means light, power, joy, spring, and enlightenment. My mandala art radiates me as a person because as a human being we exist and life as a proof and the energy inside me gives me hope to live. Despite of the struggles in life, the never ending patterns in mandala art is like a never ending problem which forms and builds us to become stronger to face the reality of life. All the never-ending challenges made us to be more beautiful as we continue to live we also learn a lot of lessons that teaches us that life starts with a simple lines and patterns until it creates wonderful as how it should be.
